# 📊 X_data_mining_R

Hey there! 👋 This is a personal learning project where I'm exploring **data mining using R** — mostly focused on **scraping, retrieving, and preparing data** that I plan to use later for training **machine learning models** (also part of my learning journey!).

I'm still in the beginner phase, so this repo is more of a hands-on playground for experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring things out as I go. If you're learning too, feel free to follow along!

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

- Collecting data from various sources (mostly web scraping)  
- Prepping and cleaning the data to make it usable  
- Structuring the datasets for future ML experiments  
- Keeping things as simple and understandable as possible  

---

## 📁 Folder & Script Info

You'll find a few R scripts that do things like:

- Scrape or retrieve data using libraries like `rvest` or `httr`  
- Convert and clean the raw data  
- Store it for later ML training or analysis  

> The code might be a little messy or commented for my own understanding — it's all part of the learning process.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure you have:

- **R** (version 3.6 or higher recommended)  
- **RStudio** (optional but super helpful)  
- These packages installed:

```r
install.packages(c("rvest", "httr", "jsonlite", "dplyr"))
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amehnd/X_data_mining_R.git
cd X_data_mining_R
```

2. Open any `.R` script in RStudio (or your favorite R editor)  
3. Run the code and experiment with it  
4. Tweak stuff, break things, learn, repeat  

---

## 🌱 Learning Goals

- Get better at **scraping and handling data**  
- Understand how to **clean and prepare data** for ML  
- Eventually dive into **machine learning** using these datasets  

---

## 💬 Notes

- This project is a **learning log**, not a polished product  
- I'm learning as I go — so if you see something that can be improved, feel free to share!  
- Suggestions, tips, or PRs are welcome (as long as they’re kind ✌️)
